Application title: Floor Tiling App

Purpose:            The tiling app allows you to calculate how many tiles you need to cover a rectangular area.

Algorithms:          1. The opening screen requests the length and the width of a room in whole feet.

2. The user selects whether the tiles are 12 inches by 12 inches or 18 inches by 18 inches.

3. The number of tiles needed to cover the area in square feet is displayed.

Submit:                A .zip file containing your completed project.

This is part two of the post-assessment for Module 04, and it can only be submitted once.

A score of 80% or better on both part one and part two of the Module 04 post-assessment will open the Module 05 pre-assessment.

A score below 80% on either part one or part two of the Module 04 post-assessment will open the Module 04 Learning Activities, so that you can learn the concepts covered in module 04.

Note: It may take up to three days for manually graded assignments to be graded.
